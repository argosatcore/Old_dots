# Goodbye, X11.

These are the dot files I used when I was an X11 user. Since Wayland has made so much progress in recent years, I finally decided to make the switch.

X11 was a decent place to learn about Linux, but looking at the possibilities offered by Wayland, it is clear to me that it is the way to go.

These files will remain here for archival purposes of what my X11 days were like.
